# What is this?
## TL;DR
In hopes of improving my anti-cheat bypassing skills, I had the idea of creating my very own anti-cheat.

## Slightly Longer Explanation
As my knowledge of not just Lua(U), but creating exploits more specifically grows, I've started making more complex scripts for games with smarter anti-cheat.

A challenge arose attempting to bypass, or work around these anti-cheats as I found myself ill-equipped to face the challenge. I had no where to start, I had close to no knowledge of how anti-cheats worked,
and I had no experience dealing with anti-cheats beyond the common stuff.

My solution was starting with creating my own anti-cheat, to learn the ways games prevent cheating, and how to prevent prevention.
